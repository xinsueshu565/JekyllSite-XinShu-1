<h2 id="are-you-crazy-i-cant-swallow-that">Are you crazy? I can’t swallow that.</h2>

<p>Oh, I don’t have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Meh. So, how ‘bout them Knicks? Also Zoidberg.</p>

<ol>
  <li>We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.</li>
  <li>Fry, we have a crate to deliver.</li>
  <li>Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="why-not-indeed">Why not indeed!</h3>

<p>Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I don’t ‘need’ to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Soothe us with sweet lies. Bender?! You stole the atom. You don’t know how to do any of those.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shinier than yours, meatbag.</li>
  <li>This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.</li>
  <li>Ooh, name it after me!</li>
</ul>

<p>Say what? Throw her in the brig. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You guys aren’t Santa! You’re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Ow, my spirit! Who’s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?</p>

<p>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You won’t have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you’ll be doing. It’s okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Hey, what kinda party is this? There’s no booze and only one hooker.</p>
