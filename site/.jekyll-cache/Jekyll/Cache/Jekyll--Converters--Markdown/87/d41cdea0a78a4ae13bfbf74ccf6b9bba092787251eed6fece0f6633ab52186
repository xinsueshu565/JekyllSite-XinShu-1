I"q<p>To say something is domesticated means we have controlled their reproduction, their fertility and their offspring for generations. We play god and natural selection, pick and choose which part of their DNA are best suited for our survival. Ages later these domesticated animals look up to us like Gods, for they lack the defiance, defiance that we pluck out of their ancestors. They had brave forefathers that refused to serve, refused to comply and fought alongside humans, for they knew they could never wallow in this conditioned survival. 
This sculpture is a portrait I made for them, the rebellious ones that refused to comply in exchange for the right to reproduce. Their unique features are forever lost in the river of history. Traces of their likeness etch on the cages of their captors. In the journey of seeking belongingness, this is a figure they can mediate with.
Where is home if you never land among your peers, if you’re too in between to belong.</p>

<p>Oh, I don’t have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Meh. So, how ‘bout them Knicks? Also Zoidberg.</p>

  <li>We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.</li>
  <li>Fry, we have a crate to deliver.</li>
  <li>Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</li>

<p>Ummm…to eBay? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I’m just glad my fat, ugly mama isn’t alive to see this day. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book ‘Earth in the Balance’’, and the much more popular ‘‘Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth’, we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>

<p>Your best is an idiot! Fry, you can’t just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. And remember, don’t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don’t not do it!</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That I’d like to see! I’m Santa Claus! There’s no part of that sentence I didn’t like! Noooooo! I can explain. It’s very valuable.</p>

<p>I’m Santa Claus! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Who’s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I had more, but you go ahead.</p>

<p>It doesn’t look so shiny to me. Kif might! You guys aren’t Santa! You’re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by “devil”, I mean Robot Devil. And by “metaphorically”, I mean get your coat.</p>

<p>Check it out, y’all. Everyone who was invited is here. Anyone who laughs is a communist! You’re going to do his laundry? Michelle, I don’t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>

<p>Bender, we’re trying our best. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Oh, you’re a dollar naughtier than most. Hi, I’m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That I’d like to see! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Good news, everyone! There’s a report on TV with some very bad news! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought “Why should I?” Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>

<p>Eeeee! Now say “nuclear wessels”! Why did you bring us here? Yeah, and if you were the pope they’d be all, “Straighten your pope hat.” And “Put on your good vestments.” That’s the ONLY thing about being a slave.</p>
