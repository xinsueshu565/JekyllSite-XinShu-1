<p>I found this sex toy in a sex shop named ‚Äúschool girl crunsh‚Äù. I was instantly struck with how tiny the sex toy is. I put this sex toy on top of true to size manniquen modelled after myself. Then I inserted a diamond ring the middle of the work. 
I am very interested in how we use youth as a weapon of attraction in our dad to day life. The concept of seeing youth as attractive is deeply ingrained in how adults interact with and attract each other. Youth has been weaponized as a mating tool and became a persona people adopted.</p>
