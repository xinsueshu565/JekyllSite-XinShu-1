To say something is domesticated means we have controlled their reproduction, their fertility and their offspring for generations. We play god and natural selection, pick and choose which part of their DNA are best suited for our survival. Ages later these domesticated animals look up to us like Gods, for they lack the defiance, defiance that we pluck out of their ancestors. They had brave forefathers that refused to serve, refused to comply and fought alongside humans, for they knew they could never wallow in this conditioned survival. 
This sculpture is a portrait I made for them, the rebellious ones that refused to comply in exchange for the right to reproduce. Their unique features are forever lost in the river of history. Traces of their likeness etch on the cages of their captors. In the journey of seeking belongingness, this is a figure they can mediate with.
Where is home if you never land among your peers, if youâ€™re too in between to belong.
