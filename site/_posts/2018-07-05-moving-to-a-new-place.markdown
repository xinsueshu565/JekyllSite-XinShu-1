This work is inspired by the nostalgic moment of a kid. That feeling you get when your nose is bleeding in the middle of the night, going to your parents' bed asking for help. The same feeling wrestles with both helplessness and trust. Trusting that your parents would know what to do when this strange new thing is happening to your body. The feeling that the helplessness would soon be alleviated.
