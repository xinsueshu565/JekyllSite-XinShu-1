     Wednesday night after I came home from a late night Denny’s visit with my boyfriend, I was left alone in this body. The body my soul is trying so hard to cling on to. 
     Nothing seems real in this body, I wanted to cut stream and marks on my body, but I don’t know why. Maybe I wanted to hurt it, change it, or punish my body  in an aesthetic way. Look mom,  my scares are butterfly shaped. Scares from my own torture, proving the mind inside of this body still exists, clinging to life. 
I need saving,
Why do I create work about my body is beyond me, it’s sounded straight out of my psyche, it looked bizarre in a lovely way. my unconscious reaching out trying to communicate with me. What do you think about my body舒馨, do you like it, does it fit who you really are? 
     I called my mom about a racist incident that happened to me in class today, she said “hey you look fatter? Did you lose the weight I told you to? “ my dad hang up the facetime call because he doesn’t want to look at my round face anymore. 
     Maybe that’s why I keep on getting tattoos and piercing, because I’m so thankful of this gift mom and dad gave me I want to wreck it, change it, modify it like I’ve seen them do on Pinterest.
     I don’t hate myself, I just hate this body.











The thing about animal prints and their pattern is—-they were born with it and they can’t change it. I envy that, their bodies serve a clear purpose they can’t afford to forget. It camouflages them and helps them mate. There are no deeper reasons beyond the ultimate goal of (surviving). Their bodies remember more of their purpose than their soul. They have no choice but to live with it, depending on it. 




I’ve been using this body for too long, not living with it.
